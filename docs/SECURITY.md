# Security

- OAuth 2.0 user consent, least‑privilege scopes.
- Webhooks signed with shared secret; rotation supported.
- Data handling: no code content stored; only PR metadata and mapping IDs.
- Audit logs: admin access, scope changes, webhook deliveries.
- Compliance alignment: SOC 2 / ISO 27001 practices (policy‑level).
